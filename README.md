# willcoin

Willcoin is a centralized Discord cryptosystem. (That's fancy talk for a bot that attaches numbers
to a user.)

## Installation

This is created on Linux Mint, a Debian based Linux distribution, and not on Windows or OSX. I would
recommend installing in Linux or in a Linux VM.

- Find an account with a bot token. The token goes in token.txt, which I am obviously not going to
add to this repo.
- Create a server that can serve as a testing server and invite the bot to that server
- Run `make install` <!-- TODO -->

<!-- TODO: write more of an Installation Guide -->
