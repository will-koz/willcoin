Thanks for using `""" + command_character + command_info + """`. Willcoin is a Discord \
cryptosystem. (It's like a cryptocurrency, but I don't feel comfortable saying that quite yet, and \

information on commands, and you can use `""" + command_character + command_ls + """` to get a \
list of all commands.

The idea of the system is that each user can have any number of wallets, and wallets can be \
associated (or have) any number of the existing Willcoin and user generated tokens. At the \
beginning of the system, all of the coins are owned by the bank, but as users begin to mint tokens \
(which are pieces of art, or memes they have saved to their drives) the bank pays out coins, but \
at a decreasing rate.

All tokens will be owned by a wallet, and a wallet can have (in theory) any number of tokens. Each \
wallet and each token has a seed, made by some of the information determined when they are \
generated, and a hash (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function), specifically generated using \
the sha256 hash algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2).

To get information about a user, make sure they are a member of the cryptosystem, and use their \
name and discriminator (tag). As this project evolves one plan is to add @ing people, but that is \
not done yet.
